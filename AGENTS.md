# Agent Instructions

## Before Making Changes

**Read the specifications first:** [specs/README.md](./specs/README.md)

The specs directory contains the product requirements and design decisions for this project. Familiarize yourself with the relevant spec before implementing or modifying features.

## Spec Documents

- `specs/dbml-import-export.md` - DBML parsing and generation
- `specs/canvas-visualization.md` - Canvas interactions and table rendering
- `specs/table-groups.md` - Table grouping functionality
- `specs/auto-layout.md` - Automatic layout algorithms
- `specs/theming-appearance.md` - Themes and color customization

## Guidelines

1. **Check specs first** - Ensure your changes align with the documented behavior
2. **Update specs if needed** - If requirements change, update the spec before or alongside the code
3. **Keep specs and code in sync** - Specs are the source of truth for intended behavior
